# Requirements of the lane video

1. Both the lanes should be in our field of view at all times.
	This is required so that the center of the lane can be established at all times.
	Vehicle needs to be in the center of the lane to avoid sharp turns to steer 
	clear of the obstacles that might be in the way

2. We should have all kinds of turns (as sharp as possible as per the rules)

3. Lane whose width varies very quickly.
